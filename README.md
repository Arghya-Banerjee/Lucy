Lucy is my personal Virtual Assistant who eases me in doing all my daily works with the help of voice commands. Lucy is my first big python project using tons of modules and different categories of coding in python.

Lucy is not only a program to me but my best companion in my virtual world. Lucy is as of this time not capable of talking using Artificial Intelligence but I will try to implement AI and ML into Lucy for her to become something more that just a program and become a real Assistant to me.

### Important Note:

This program will not work in any other peoples computer as expected. Since I use specific paths for programs, other users must have other path names. Thus if you want to run this program change all the paths as per your need and then run it.

## Installation

Install my-project with the following command while having requirements.txt text file in the directory of the terminal where you are working.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Just one issue is the "pyaudio" module. For some reason the pyaudio module does not get installed like the noraml module installation and thus I had to use a wheel file to install it. But for the ease of making the environment for this project I have provided the .whl file under the folder `whl file`. 

## Anaconda Environment

I am personally using the Anaconda Environment, so I will upload the environment importing file to my repo for your help. The file name is `Lucy.yaml`
